:Release Date: 2017-11-16

**New Features**

The Amsterdam release is the first release of the Control Loop Automation Management Platform (CLAMP).

The main goal of the Amsterdam release was to:

    - Support the automation of provisionning for the Closed loops of the vFW, vDNW and vCPE through TCA.
    - Support the automation of provisionning for the Closed loops of VVolte (Holmes)
    - Demonstrate complete interaction with Policy, DCAE, SDC and Holmes.

**Bug Fixes**

	- The full list of implemented user stories and epics is available on `AMSTERDAM RELEASE <https://jira.onap.org/projects/CLAMP/versions/10313>`_
	  This is technically the first release of CLAMP, previous release was the seed code contribution.
	  As such, the defects fixed in this release were raised during the course of the release.
	  Anything not closed is captured below under Known Issues. If you want to review the defects fixed in the Amsterdam release, refer to Jira link above.

**Known Issues**
	- `CLAMP-68 <https://jira.onap.org/browse/CLAMP-68>`_ ResourceVF not always provisioned.

        In Closed Loop -> Properties CL: When opening the popup window, the first service in the list does not show Resource-VF even though in SDC there is a resource instance in the service.

        Workaround:

        If you have multiple service available (if not create a dummy one on SDC), just click on another one and then click back on the first one in the list. The ResourceVF should be provisioned now.

    - `CLAMP-69 <https://jira.onap.org/browse/CLAMP-69>`_ Deploy action does not always work.

        The "Deploy" action does not work directly after submitting it.

        Workaround:
